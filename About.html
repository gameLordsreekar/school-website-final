<h3> Dear parents,<br>

Welcome to the Vagdevi Vilas family. At Vagdevi Vilas, we believe that every human being ( vyakti) has a latent strength (shakti)<br>
which is waiting to be realized. A strength which is moving towards perfection.<br>
Every person in the world has a special role, a special talent, a special strength. Everybody does his bit to contribute to the world<br> 
to make it a better place than it was yesterday. An Edison could give light to the world, through a Gandhiji, the world understood <br> 
the importance of non-violence, a Montessori could re-write the language of child education, a Vivekananda could make the entire<br> 
India stand up with self confidence. Similarly, your child could have hidden talents which need to be developed.<br> 
Just as a good sculptor sees a beautiful sculpture in every stone, Vagdevi Vilas Institutions realize the existence<br> 
of a great strength in every child. It sees tomorrow’s leaders in today’s children.<br> 
Tata’s entrepreneurship, Bhagat Singh’s patriotism, Baba Amte’s service to the backward community, environmentalist<br> 
Thimmakka’s concern for the ecosystem, Abhinav Bhindra’s Olympic achievement, if an element of all these qualities<br> 
could be inculcated in our children, wouldn’t that be great?<br> 
Come, bring your child to Vagdevi Vilas Institutions. Welcome to a special environment that encourages and shapes your<br> 
child’s hidden talents, splendid dreams and enthusiastic attempts.<br> 
We appeal to you to support us in our endeavour to prepare tomorrow’s sculptors.<br> 
 We are with you.</h3><br>
